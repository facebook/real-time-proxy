=== Facebook Graph Proxy with Realtime Invalidation ===
The Facebook Graph Proxy is a simple proxy for graph.facebook.com that takes
advantage of the Realtime Updates feature to invalidate stale data. It can be
used by replacing references to graph.facebook.com with references to the
proxy.

== Installation ==
To install:

    python setup.py build
    sudo python setup.py install

The Facebook Graph Proxy also requires the CherryPy WSGI server to function.
This may be installed using:

    sudo easy_install cherrypy

== Configuration ==
To start, copy config.sample into config.txt. From here, you will need to
update the following values:

    proxy_port: the port on which the server will listen for requests which
                need to be proxied.
    realtime_port: the port on which the server will listen for Realtime
                   Updates from Facebook.
    cache_entries: The number of entries that should be stored in the cache
                   before dropping the least-recently-used entry
    public_hostname: The publicly-visible hostname that Facebook should use
                     to reach the Realtime Update endpoint of this server

In addition, you will need to enter information about the Facebook
Applications which will be using this server. See the config file for details.

== Security Considerations ==
In order to avoid leaking data about users, the proxy port must only be
accessible by your own servers.

== Execution instructions ==
To run the proxy:

  start_proxy [config_file]

If config_file is not passed, then the proxy will default to using config.txt.
